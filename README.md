# Hangman Game

## Description

This is a simple text-based Hangman game implemented in Python. The player has to guess a randomly selected word by suggesting letters one at a time. The game visually represents the state of the hangman and the progress of the word being guessed. The player wins by guessing all the letters correctly before running out of lives.

## How It Works

1. **Importing Resources:**
   - The game imports a logo and the stages of the hangman from external files (`hangman_art.py`) for visual representation.
   - A list of words (`hangman_words.py`) is imported, from which a word is randomly selected for the game.

2. **Game Setup:**
   - A word is randomly chosen from the imported word list.
   - The game initializes the display to represent the word with underscores (`_`), where each underscore corresponds to a letter in the word.

3. **Gameplay:**
   - The player is prompted to guess a letter.
   - The game checks if the guessed letter is in the word:
     - If the guess is correct, the corresponding underscores are replaced with the guessed letter.
     - If the guess is incorrect, the player loses a life, and the hangman is progressively drawn.
   - The player is notified if they have already guessed a letter, made an invalid guess (like guessing more than one letter or leaving the input blank), or run out of lives.

4. **Game End:**
   - The game continues until the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives.
   - The player is informed if they win or lose at the end of the game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The `hangman_art.py` and `hangman_words.py` files should be in the same directory as the main script.

### How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure that `hangman_art.py` contains the `logo` and `stages` variables.
3. Ensure that `hangman_words.py` contains a list named `word_list` with multiple words.
4. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python hangman.py
   ```

5. Follow the prompts to play the game.

### Example Usage

- The player guesses letters to complete the word.
- The game will provide feedback after each guess, including the current state of the word and the number of remaining lives.
